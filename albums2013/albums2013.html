				<h1>#5 CUPID DELUXE</h1>
				<h2>by Blood Orange</h2>
				<p class="review">Dev Haynes, AKA Blood Orange, has proven that he is an excellent, well-rounded producer (Solange, Sky Ferreira, Chemical Brothers, etc) as well as a solo artist. In his latest work, <em>Cupid Deluxe</em>, he explores even more genre-bending song writing. With everything from funk to jazz and old school hip hop to R&B, Blood Orange truly delights the listener in each track. Even the iconic hip hop scratches from the early 90s find their place amongst vibrant, full orchestral arrangements. Although it took me a couple play throughs to fully embrace this album, it quickly became my most-played in November.<br><br>Listen: <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVmAayJnfD8/">Rdio</a> | <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/3KIRi1cU8yt3w7xhmiyehM">Spotify</a></p>

				<h1>#4 YEEZUS</h1>
				<h2>by Kanye West</h2>
				<p class="review">Kanye West is a beast. There is no denying his impact on the world of pop culture and the rap genre. Never afraid to try new things or say what’s on his mind, Mr. West is free to do as he pleases. With his most recent venture, <em>Yesus</em>, we find a worn out, beaten down, introspective, yet unrelentingly optimistic Kanye. Make no mistake, Ye is angry on this album. His minimal production brings his vocals and harsh, exasperated voice to the forefront, forcing the listener to feel his pain… in a most enjoyable way. While this album can’t touch his opus, <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>,  <em>Yeezus</em> solidifies Kanye’s freedom to make <em>his</em> music.<br><br>Listen: <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVmAayJw9oQ/">Rdio</a> | <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/0XTAmejG8F97wF5MWoVbaY">Spotify</a></p>

				<h1>#3 MODERN VAMPIRES <br> OF THE CITY</h1>
				<h2>by Vampire Weekend</h2>
				<p class="review">I was ready to hate Vampire Weekend after their sophomore album, <em>Contra</em>. I thought that their flame would have burned out and people would only be able to take so much of a Paul Simon cover band. But no, they had to prove me wrong. They had to release an album so honest and open about a frequently visited topic as death and make it into a romantic comedy. A tragedy that we all embrace and don’t know how. Vampy Weeks talk about the end of days with a smile on their face and and a jump in their “step.” <em>Modern Vampires of the City</em> gets better with every listen, allowing you to find all the little easter eggs scattered throughout. Man, I really didn’t want to like this album…<br><br>Listen: <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVmAayJxFAo/">Rdio</a> | <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2Qi2SySN2ePZwMLDSv9Krn">Spotify</a></p>

				<h1>#2 RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES</h1>
				<h2>by Daft Punk</h2>
				<p class="review">Daft Punk released an album that was written and produced in the past and present at the same time. It is an absolute brain buster. With a (basically) unlimited budget, Daft Punk set out to make an homage to the music that they love, using 70s recording methods that very few members of their fan base will even notice. However, even if you can’t hear a difference between the production of this album and a Disclosure (puke) album, you should appreciate the time and energy spent creating something so special. The featured list is… nuts, and fit perfectly. Who knew Panda Bear (Animal Collective) would work on a Daft Punk track? Not me. Bring back Nile Rodgers (Chic) from the grave and make him play a couple incredible riffs? Sure! Pharrell can sing on this track (Get Lucky) and make it the hit of the summer (Suck it, Blurred Lines). Genius. <br><br>Listen: <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVmAayJy0K8/">Rdio</a> | <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/4m2880jivSbbyEGAKfITCa">Spotify</a></p>

				<h1>#1 PSYCHIC</h1>
				<h2>by Darkside</h2>
				<p class="review">Darkside is a collaborative project between Nicolas Jaar and Dave Harrington. Being a huge fan of Jaar’s solo work, I had high hopes for this new album that was shrouded in mystery. It delivered. Every track molds into something unique and allows the listener to start grooving in and out of the ebbs and flows of their masterpiece. I should use the term “unique” loosely, as there is some very close similarities to prog-rock that makes me cringe to think about (Could their name be some sort of homage to the Pink Floyd classic?) yet those feeling quickly pass and are replaced with joy and comfort as the beat eventually drops and carries me away to some euphoric state. Jaar’s often times unrecognizable lyrics pass through the experience, giving the listener something to hum to. Harrington’s guitars are precise and calculated, breathing life into the monotonous (in a good way) drum patterns. <em>Psychic</em> is all about feeling, and damn do I feel good.<br><br>Listen: <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVmAayJqzv8/">Rdio</a> | <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/7jqNrm1l4wSxNYSjgK7tmF">Spotify</a></p>
